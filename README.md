# War Of Tolusin

This game is a hybrid of tower-defense and a top-down shooter. You are in full control of your tank to defend the base as the enemies come along the path. You can upgrade your tank or the towers by collecting coins from dead enemies. This provides more freedom for the player as they can entirely invest in one thing (towers), instead of the character's tank for example. The player's tank will be equipped with a coin magnet which will pull coins nearby towards the player and other 2 powerful abilities that will help the player turns the tide of the battle.

This project was made back in May-June 2021 as part of an internship and was discontinued since.
